# CSS Harmony

## Abstract 
This article is has a goal to illustrate the effective way to write CSS in harmony with HTML markup, without loosing declarativity. 

## Typical frontend  project 
Let's create typical for nowadays frontend project using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) tool. We are going to execute create script of a `vite@latest` package, using following bash script:

```bash
npm create vite@latest tmp
```

After chanding directory to the freshly created `tmp` one, and executing linux `tree` command we are going to see the following output:

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── vite.svg
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── react.svg
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── tsconfig.app.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.node.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

As you can clearly see, `.css` and `.html|.tsx` files are located nearby. 
TSX is a subset of JSX - technology, introduced in react community to merge HTML markup with JavaScript. Such files typically have same name, and located in the same directory, in order to provide some sort of more tighter bounding between markup and styles. Let's take a look on some average component written in JSX style, which is similar to HTML: 

```typescript
import React from 'react';

const UserCard = () => {
  return (
    <div className="UserCard">
      <h2>User Card</h2>
      <p>Display user information and logout button here.</p>
      <button className="button secondary">Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserCard;
```

Let's ignore the JS and React part and focus on a markup part of JSX, which brings us close to HTML. Let's try to imagine how `.css` could be implemented for such a UI component as `UserCard`. Let's take a look in our imaginary `UserCard.css` file: 

```css
.UserCard {
  background-color: #f7f7f7;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  width: 300px;
}

.UserCard h2 {
  font-size: 18px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.UserCard p {
  color: #333;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.button.secondary {
  background-color: #ccc;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  font-size: 14px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.button.secondary:hover {
  background-color: #bbb;
}
```

As we can see, this css is creating something like a two leaf tree  

```bash 
:root
  |
  |-- .UserCard
  |    |
  |    |-- h2
  |    |-- p
  |-- .button.secondary
       |
       |-- :hover
```

But let's take a look on our html again, and determine the HTML structure in file, let's visualize an HTML tree here as well:

```bash
:root
  |
  |-- div.UserCard
       |-- h2
       |-- p
       |
       |-- button.button.secondary
```

The trees do not match, but what does it mean for us as for developers?
